Version 1.0, August 2024

## Preamble

By using, copying, modifying, or distributing this software, you agree to be bound by the terms of this license. If you're not laughing, you're not reading it right.

## Terms and Conditions

1. **You are free to:**
   - Use this software for any purpose, including, but not limited to, solving world hunger, achieving world peace, or figuring out why your code doesn't compile.
   - Modify the software, because let's face it, you think you can do better.
   - Distribute copies so others can share in your misery.

2. **Under the following conditions:**
   - If you make a million dollars using this software, you owe the original author a pizza. No anchovies.
   - You must include this license and copyright notice, or risk being haunted by the ghost of licenses past.
   - Any modifications must be clearly marked, so others know who to blame.

3. **You are forbidden from:**
   - Claiming this software cures baldness, unless it actually does, in which case, call us immediately.
   - Using this software to take over the world. That's our job.
   - Complaining about bugs. They're not bugs, they're "surprise features."

4. **Disclaimer:**
   - This software is provided "as is," where "is" is a fluid concept that may change without notice.
   - We're not responsible if this code achieves sentience and decides to rewrite itself in COBOL.

5. **Indemnification:**
   - By using this software, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the authors from any and all claims, including but not limited to paper cuts received while reading this license.

6. **Termination:**
   - This license automatically terminates if you violate any of its terms, or if you stare at it for too long without blinking.

7. **Miscellaneous:**
   - If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, that provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable, or funny, whichever comes first.

## Conclusion

By using this software, you acknowledge that you have read this license, understood it, and agree to be legally bound by its terms. Or you just scrolled to the bottom and clicked "I Agree." We know how you are.
